Chapter 3: A Killer’s Game
Serena faced Halstrom, now in his eighties, but his cold, dismissive attitude only fueled her frustration. “That case was buried years ago,” he said, his voice indifferent. “It’s irrelevant now.”

Serena realized she was no longer just investigating; she was now a player in the killer’s twisted game, racing against time to prevent another murder.
