Final Draft of The Midnight Cipher

Epilogue: Justice in Shadows

Halstrom was charged with obstruction of justice but faced no significant consequences. Rebecca’s trial divided public opinion, with many viewing her as a vigilante.

Serena returned to her desk, haunted by the case. The Midnight Cipher had been cracked, but justice still felt out of reach.

Chapter 1: The Letter and the Body

The letter was plain, but its message was far from ordinary:
"The clock strikes twelve, and blood spills. Solve the cipher, or it happens again."

Detective Serena Kane read it twice, her mind already dissecting its meaning. The accompanying cipher—a grid of letters—demanded attention. But there was no sender, no context, and no immediate leads. She made a copy, bagged the original as evidence, and added it to her growing collection of unsolved oddities.

The murder came an hour later: Professor Edward Grant, a cryptologist, found dead in his apartment. The crime scene told a clear story of violence. Blood pooled beneath the body, his throat slit cleanly. But it was the cipher written in blood on the desk that caught her attention—a deliberate signature from a calculated mind.

The victim’s connection to ciphers felt too deliberate to be a coincidence. She called Nate Branson, a cybersecurity expert and cryptographer, for help. Nate cracked the first message:
"The past is never buried. Look beneath the veil."

What veil? And what past? The questions gnawed at her as she delved into Grant’s life.
