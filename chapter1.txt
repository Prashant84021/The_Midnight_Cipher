Chapter 1: The Letter and the Body

The letter was chilling in its simplicity:
"The clock strikes twelve, and blood spills. Solve the cipher, or it happens again."

Detective Serena Kane felt her pulse quicken as she read the message. It wasn’t just a threat—it was a dare, meant to provoke her. She copied the letter into her notebook, jotting questions alongside it. Who had sent it? And why her?

Hours later, she stood in Professor Edward Grant’s apartment, staring at his lifeless body. Blood trailed across his desk, where a cipher had been written in jagged lines. The deliberate, almost ceremonial nature of the scene made her uneasy.

Serena knew she wasn’t just dealing with a murderer. She was up against someone who wanted to be understood—and feared.
